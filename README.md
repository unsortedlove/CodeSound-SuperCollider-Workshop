# CodeSound: SuperCollider Workshop

*An introduction to sound synthesis and live coding with SuperCollider.*

---

## Overview  

**CodeSound** is an introduction to sound synthesis and algorithmic composition using [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), a powerful open-source programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic music.  
 
Participants will learn the basics of SuperCollider’s language, synthesis engine, and pattern system. Through live coding exercises and creative experimentation, the workshop will explore how to generate, shape, and control sound structures in real-time. Sessions will also touch on approaches to improvisation, rhythmic systems, and working with randomness and repetition.  

By the end of the workshop, participants will have the tools to start building their own sonic environments, instruments, and generative compositions.

## About the Workshop  

In August, we hosted a 4-day introduction to sound synthesis and live coding with SuperCollider at Unsorted Space in Zurich. We explored the basics of synthesis, sound design, and live coding techniques in a hands-on format for beginners.  

All workshop materials and examples are now available on GitHub — free to download, learn, and experiment with.
