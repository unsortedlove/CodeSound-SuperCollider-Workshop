CodeSound: SuperCollider Workshop

 An introduction to sound synthesis and live coding with SuperCollider.

Overview CodeSound is an introduction to sound synthesis and algorithmic composition using SuperCollider, a powerful open-source programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic music. This workshop is designed for artists, musicians, and curious minds interested in exploring sound through code—no prior programming experience is required.

Participants will learn the basics of SuperCollider’s language, synthesis engine, and pattern system. Through live coding exercises and creative experimentation, the workshop will explore how to generate, shape, and control sound structures in real-time. Sessions will also touch on approaches to improvisation, rhythmic systems, and working with randomness and repetition.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have the tools to start building their own sonic environments, instruments, and generative compositions.

Topics Covered

Introduction to SuperCollider language and IDE
Synth definitions and real-time sound synthesis
Working with patterns and Pbind
Control structures, randomness, and scheduling
Live coding and performance techniques
Listening strategies and improvisation
Requirements

A laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux) with SuperCollider installed: Download here
Headphones
Curiosity and openness to experiment with sound

In August, we hosted a 4-day introduction to sound synthesis and live coding with SuperCollider at Unsorted Space in Zurich.
We explored the basics of synthesis, sound design, and live coding techniques in a hands-on format for beginners.
All workshop materials and examples are now available on GitHub — free to download, learn, and experiment with.
